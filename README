# conSERN

conSERN contains code for fast-generation of Spatially Embedded Random
Networks (SERNs), such as the Waxman random graph, random plane
networks, random geometric graphs, spatial networks, range-dependent
random graphs, random connection models, random distance graphs, and
partially structured random graphs.

### Contents
The directories are
    conSERN:   C source code
                 conSERN.c has Matlab linking routines
		 FastSERN.c has C library entry point (GenSERN)

    Matlab:    examples, and tests using Matlab through a Mex file


### Installation

(1)
   Mac OSX installation is via Xcode.

   Linux
     Enter the ./conSERN sub-directory, and type
         make
     This should construct the libraries, and a Matlab Mex file (for
     linux) if mex is all set up for you.

     Some modifications to the makefile might be needed for
     local customisation, e.g., you need to set the includes to point
     to your install.

     You might also need to change the version of C compiler being
     used. e.g., see
         https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/137228-setup-mex-compiler-for-r2014a-for-linux
     Essentially it requires installation of an earlier compiler
     version, and then editing of (for instance) 
         ~/.matlab/R2017a/mex_C_glnxa64.xml 
         ~/.matlab/R2017a/mex_C++_glnxa64.xml
     to point Matlab at the new version.	 

(2) Enter the ./Matlab sub-directory. The "testgen.m" matlab script should now work.

(3) If you want to get all of the tests reported in [1] then you also
    need to install the "Linepicking" package from
        https://github.com/mroughan/LinePicking
    and set the appropriate paths in linepicking.m
 
(4) If you want to run this from another directory, then you will have
    to set up an appropriate search path.
